Hydrocraft is a mod based around crafting and filling in the empty world of zomboid with more stuff. It is inspired by survival crafting games like Haven and Hearth. This mod is currently the latest and the one that is being updated.

There are 2 other main hydrocraft mods. One is the b40 version made by Hydromancerx and is no longer being updated. The other one is by David Hasihoff on steam. This was the previous version of hydrocraft for b41, but is now no longer updated. I am now taking over with some help to continue fixing and improving Hydrocraft as a whole.
